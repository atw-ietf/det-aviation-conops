# Introduction

## Purpose

This document provides to stakeholders in a National Airspace System (NAS), such as a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and its constituents, a point of entry into a set of relevant standards. These standards provide guidance to enable trustworthy Air Domain Awareness (ADA) primarily via cooperative technologies. Such technologies can include, but are not limited to, Unmanned Aircraft (UA) Systems (UAS) Remote Identification (RID), UAS Traffic Management (UTM) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). 

This document specifies an interoperable manner of achieving the stated objectives in an international context to be used by CAAs in a relevant Means of Compliance (MOC). One such MOC is {{ASTM.F3586}} for UAS RID to comply with the United States (US) CAA regulations.

A CAA MAY mandate through other mechanisms additional requirements beyond this document for UAS interoperability in their jurisdiction.

## Background

Trustworthiness revolves around identification and authentication. {{RFC9374}} defines the Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Entity Tag (DET), a trustable identifier backed by asymmetric cryptography. {{RFC9575}} standardizes authentication of DETs and associated information using strong cryptography suited for constrained mobile wireless links (typical of Broadcast RID). Broadcast and Network RID are defined by {{ASTM.F3411}} which designates the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to maintain code-points for Specific Session ID Types and Specific Authentication Methods (SAMs) {{ICAO.RID}}. ICAO includes DETs as a Specific Session ID Type and lists the four DRIP SAMs of {{RFC9575}}.

DETs generated by registrants (typically a UAS Operator or UAS) are merely proposed until they are registered within the hierarchy consisting of at least two levels above the leaf DET: Registered Assigning Authority (RAA) and Hierarchial Host Identity Tag (HHIT) Domain Authority (HDA). The registry system, made up of DRIP Identity Management Entities (DIMEs) acting as either RAAs or HDAs, ensures uniqueness within the hierarchy, endorses inclusion through X.509 certificates, and provides access to public and private information associated with a DET registration. Public information is served using the Domain Name System (DNS) and is specified in {{DET.DNS}}. Private information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), is served using the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP, {{STD95}}) and protected through policy based differentiated access.

## Scope

Participating entities are assumed in this document to be in compliance with relevant existing UAS standards such as {{ASTM.F3411}}, {{ASTM.F3548}} and {{ICAO.ACCP}}.

This document governs use of a DET in the following cases:

1. An entity that uses a Session ID (some participating entities, e.g. HDAs, may not need Session IDs), MUST use a DET for that Session ID.
2. An entity that participates in DRIP interactions (even if not needing a Session ID), MUST use a DET for the DRIP public authentication key ID in those interactions.
3. An entity that requires a strongly cryptographically verifiable IP compatible identifier, MAY use a DET for any other legal purpose.
4. An entity SHOULD NOT use a DET as a locator in physical or logical space (e.g. as a globally routable IPv6 address outside of an overlay network), as deconflation is intended, see {{RFC9063}}.

The archetypal case is a UAS for which the DET serves as both the UAS ID (first case above) and the Authentication Key ID (second case).
